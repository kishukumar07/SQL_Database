eg .. Here's a note for the concept of "Objects"

1. Defination:
      Object is a data type that stores data in the form of key -value  pairs. it also allows actions to be performed on this data using methods. 

2.  when to use it with Example use cases ...
    it is used whenever you have unordered data which has to be fetched using a property or field name.  
    Example use cases: 
       -Amazon_User: keys are name , age ,gender ,address ,orders,Payment_method
       -product: name, price ,rating , reviews ,inventory 


3. Benifits: 
    Unlike Arrays ,with Objects you don't need to search information in the whole array. you can fetch the required value simply from its key . 

4. Extra information:
    Objects can also capture the entity's behavior using Object methods. 
    Example: For Product  . it could be get Average Rating ().
    for Amazon_user it could be get orderList().
